Simulations: 
* jackknife_simulation.ipynb (Jupyter notebook), jackknife_simulation.html (html version).
* The code has an option to include or exclude the full conformal prediction method. By default this is set to False as the full CP method takes an extremely long time to run. If set to True, the code then depends on the nonconformist library (https://github.com/donlnz/nonconformist).


Real data experiments: 
* jackknife_realdata.ipynb (Jupyter notebook), jackknife_realdata.html (html version).
* See code for instructions for how to download the data sets.
* Code needed for data preprocessing: get_meps_data.ipynb
